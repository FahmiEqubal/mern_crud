# About Me

Hello, I'm Equbal Fahmi, a passionate developer with a strong interest in web development and full-stack applications. I specialize in creating robust and user-friendly CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications. Currently, I'm excited to share one of my recent projects with you:

## Project: MERN CRUD Application

https://github.com/FahmiEqubal/mern_crud.git

### Overview

I've developed a CRUD application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This application allows users to manage a simple dataset that includes name, email, and age. Key features of the project include:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application boasts an intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with and manage their data.

- **Validation**: To ensure data integrity, email addresses are required to be unique. The application checks for uniqueness and provides user-friendly error messages when necessary.

- **RESTful API**: The backend is built with Express.js and Node.js, offering a RESTful API for performing CRUD operations.

- **MongoDB Database**: Data is stored securely in a MongoDB database, providing scalability and performance.

### Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- Other: Git, GitHub, REST API
